/* BINARY HEAPS
Very similar to a binary search tree, but 
with some different rules!

In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

# MAX BINARY HEAP #
#   Each parent has at most two child nodes
#   The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
#   In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
#   A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node
    are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

    Why do we need to know this?
Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues,
which are very commonly used data structures

They are also used quite a bit,
with graph traversal algorithms
